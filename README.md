# A skeleton project for python

This project tries to capture and represent the current best practice
for Python project layout.

Because best practices change over time and this project runs in
low-maintenance mode, we try to keep it minimalistic... to minimize
the impact of any errors or false suggestions presented here, and to
make them easier to fix.
